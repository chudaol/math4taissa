# Introduction

This nice small book will help you, my dearest young friends to love and enjoy math. It'll also help you to understand that math is not just numbers and calculations that you must study in school. Math is something which surrounds us in our daily life, each hour, every minute, every second. Every second million events happen, thousands discounts are being applied and cars are making hundreds kilometers per hour. And please tell me, how many seconds are there in one day? And in one month? And what about a year?
