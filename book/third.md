###6. You remember from the previous section that you would need more **130** two-euro coins to obtain **2000** euros. Someone gave to you the glass of 150ml full of 2-euro coins (remember, the shape doesn't matter for us). Do you think this amount is enough for you to obtain what you want?

<small><span class="gray">Hint</span>: Remember from the previous sections what is the volume of one 2-euro coin. Make a necessary division to understand how many coins are there in the glass. Do not forget to round to the integer number.</small>
